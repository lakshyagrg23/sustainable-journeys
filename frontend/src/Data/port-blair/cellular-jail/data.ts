    description:
      "Constructed by the British between 1896 and 1906, the Cellular Jail is a stark and somber architectural marvel that stands as a powerful symbol of immense sacrifice. Its unique design, with **seven massive wings radiating from a central tower**, was specifically engineered to house political prisoners in complete solitary confinement, preventing any form of communication. The very walls of this place echo the resilience and indomitable spirit of countless freedom fighters, including prominent figures like **Veer Savarkar**, who endured unimaginable hardships for the sake of India's independence. A walk through the narrow corridors and the grim cells, including the gallows, offers a deeply emotional and harrowing glimpse into the suffering and courage that shaped the nation's history.",
