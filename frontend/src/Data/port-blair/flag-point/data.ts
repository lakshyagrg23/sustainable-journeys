      "Flag Point is a location of profound historical significance, serving as a powerful symbol of India's independence struggle. It marks the precise spot where **Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose** first hoisted the flag of the Provisional Government of Free India on December 30, 1943. This historic event preceded India's official independence and is commemorated with a dedicated monument. Today, the area offers more than just a history lesson. It's a tranquil coastal stretch where visitors can feel the fresh sea breeze and enjoy panoramic views of the ocean. The unique combination of patriotic reverence and natural serenity makes Flag Point a must-visit for anyone looking to connect with a key moment in the nation's past while soaking in the natural beauty of Port Blair's shoreline.",
