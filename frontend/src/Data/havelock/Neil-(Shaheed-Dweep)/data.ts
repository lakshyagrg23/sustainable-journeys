    description:
      "The journey to the Natural Rock formation is a unique adventure in itself. Accessible only during low tide, visitors must carefully walk across a vibrant seabed that is teeming with life. As you make your way towards the arch, the receding waters leave behind countless miniature aquariums in the form of tidal pools. These pools are home to a fascinating array of marine creatures, from resilient **starfish** and scurrying **crabs** to sea cucumbers and tiny, colorful fish. This walk offers a rare opportunity for a close-up look at the coastal ecosystem, making the journey as memorable and rewarding as the destination itself.",

    title: "A Photogenic Natural Landmark",
    description:
      "The Natural Rock, an awe-inspiring arch sculpted over millennia by the relentless force of the sea, is a monument to nature’s artistry. This iconic landmark is one of the most photographed spots in the Andamans, and for good reason. Its rugged, naturally curved arch provides a perfect frame for capturing stunning photos of the surrounding landscape and the vast ocean. During high tide, waves crash dramatically against the arch, creating a spectacle of spray and foam. The unique combination of the geological formation, the lush greenery, and the powerful backdrop of the sea makes it a must-visit for photographers, nature lovers, and anyone who appreciates the raw, untamed beauty of the Andaman Islands.",
