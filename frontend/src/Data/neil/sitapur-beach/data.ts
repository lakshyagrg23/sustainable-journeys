      "The journey to the iconic Natural Rock is a unique and captivating experience in itself, accessible only during low tide. As the sea recedes, it unveils a dramatic landscape of exposed corals and tidal pools, creating a natural pathway to the rock bridge. This walk is a fascinating mini-safari, where you can carefully observe a vibrant ecosystem teeming with life. The shallow pools act as miniature aquariums, revealing a variety of marine creatures like starfish, small crabs, sea cucumbers, and colorful snails. This intimate encounter with coastal biodiversity, combined with the anticipation of reaching the magnificent arch, makes the journey as rewarding as the destination for every nature enthusiast.",
