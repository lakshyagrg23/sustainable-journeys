      "Lamiya Bay Beach, Andaman Island is a picturesque coastal stretch that offers a completely different charm compared to the typical sandy beaches of the islands. Its shoreline is dotted with smooth pebbles, driftwood, and rocky formations shaped naturally by the tides, creating a rugged yet captivating landscape. Visitors who arrive here often find themselves drawn to the quiet beauty of the coast, where every stone and piece of driftwood seems to tell its own story of the sea. The beach also serves as a gateway to the lush forest trails of Saddle Peak National Park, making it an ideal starting point for treks and nature walks. Exploring these trails allows travelers to enjoy the perfect blend of coastal and forest experiences—watching the waves crash at the shore one moment, and stepping into green, shaded pathways the next. For adventure seekers, photographers, and those who love walking through nature’s raw beauty, Lamiya Bay Beach is a truly rewarding stop.",
