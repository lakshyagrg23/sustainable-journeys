      "The Saddle Peak In North Andaman provides you with a hiking trail that opens with a broad walkway that is surrounded by tall trees and which creates a calm atmosphere. Moving forward, you will come across a unique green and red billboard that offers information about the forest's various flora. As you proceed on the prescribed path, you will come to an intersection where a blue sign points to a change in direction. While a particular path turns left and heads toward the shore, the other stays straight and winds through the thick vegetation along towards the coast. Hikers can select the path in this Offbeat Destination In Andaman that most closely suits their interests and preferences from two separate paths that each offer something different.",
