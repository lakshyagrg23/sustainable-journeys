      "A quiet, clean beach ideal for relaxed strolls, picnics, and nature lovers seeking less-crowded shores. Karmatang Beach is often described as one of the most pristine stretches in Mayabunder, where the wide sandy shoreline meets gentle waves of the Andaman Sea. The atmosphere is peaceful, making it a great spot to simply unwind, read a book under the shade of trees, or enjoy long leisurely walks. Families can plan day trips here, as the beach has enough open space for small picnics, games, and relaxed outdoor activities without the rush of tourist crowds.",

    title: "Turtle Season",
    description:
      "During nesting months, parts of the beach are protected—an important conservation effort in the region. Karmatang is famous for being a significant nesting ground for sea turtles, particularly between December and February, when conservation teams set up protective measures to safeguard turtle eggs. Visitors may get a chance to witness the conservation efforts firsthand, and with some luck, even see turtles making their way to or from the sea. This blend of natural beauty and ecological importance makes Karmatang not just a tourist spot, but also an educational experience about marine wildlife and environmental care.",
